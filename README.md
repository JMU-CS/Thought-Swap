# Thought-Swap #

## Overview ##

We have developed a tool, called ThoughtSwap, to help widen and deepen the scope of participation in facilitated discussions while supporting, not supplanting, discussants’ coordination. By driving the design of ThoughtSwap toward a simpler mechanism, we were able to create a more versatile, high-impact tool. We design for an educational setting, but see wider possible use. For more see the [publication](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1718934). 

ThoughtSwap allows students to submit thoughts anonymously to their teacher who can then release those thoughts to be distributed randomly. Students will then be able to consider another’s thoughts in a discussion where self-consciousness, social intimidation, and time pressure are minimized.
The main goal of the project is to provide a platform to classrooms teaching any age that supports dynamic classroom interactions centered around student discussion.
