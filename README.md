# ![Thought-Swap](app/resources/project_logo.png)

A web app that aims to widen and deepen the scope of participation in 
facilitated discussions by minimizing participant self-consciousness,
social intimidation, and time pressure.

## Project in Action
ThoughtSwap is actively being tested and used at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu)
in classroom discussions. You can view the project's home at
[thoughtswap.cs.vt.edu](http://thoughtswap.cs.vt.edu/)

For discussion facilitators, ThoughtSwap provides a platform for the creation of
groups, group sessions with prompts and a platform to moderate and discuss 
responses. For participants, a platform for viewing the prompt, and sharing
prompts is available while a system of "silly name" generation of usernames and
random thought distribution helps to anonymize them from their peers.

A demo of this can be seen below:

```
TODO: Add 1 gif for the facilitator flow and 1 for student flow
```
