    <strong>Something About</strong>
    <p>
      ThoughtSwap allows students to submit thoughts anonymously to their teacher who can then release those thoughts to be distributed randomly. The main goal of the project is to provide a platform to classrooms teaching any age that supports dynamic classroom interactions centered around student discussion.
    </p>

    <strong>Something Academic</strong>
    <p>
      One can ask students to submit multiple perspectives on a prompt, ask them to view the collection of thoughts a teacher receives, and organize them categorically, as well as ask them to argue another studentâ€™s thought they receive via distribution.
